I'm a geologist driven by curiosity and love in the geoscience field. My journey so far has been marked by a commitment to collaborative work and a passion for exploring the potential within data. I've had the privilege of contributing to various projects, where teamwork and effective communication played crucial roles.

In dynamic environments, I've found my niche, navigating through programming languages like SQL and Python, and exploring visualization tools such as PowerBI, Tableau, and Looker. I'm also familiar with 3D modeling software like Leapfrog and Micromine. I've also had the chance to create automated systems for data analysis and user convenience. My aspiration is to bring my skills and experiences to a forwardthinking organization, where I can contribute to innovative initiatives and achieve success together.
