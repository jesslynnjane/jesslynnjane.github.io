Hey there! I'm Jesslyn Jane, but everyone calls me JJ. I'm a geologist and a data enthusiast, currently living back and forth from Singapore to Indonesia.

I am currently working in mining, following a schedule where I'm on-site for four weeks and off-site for two. On-site, I crunch data as a database geologist. Off-site, I work on projects, like the portfolio you're checking out now.

I've always been so excited with numbers and handling data, so feel free to check it out my portfolio [here](/portofolio/). Besides work, I'm all about traveling and drawing. I pour my heart into my art, and you can see some of them here.

Let's stay in touch! Drop me a message at jesslyn [dot] jane [dot] k [at] gmail [dot] com. See you there :)
