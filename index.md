Hey there! I'm Jesslyn Jane, but everyone calls me JJ. I'm a geologist and a data enthusiast, currently living in Aachen, Germany.

At the moment, I'm pursuing my dream to travel the world. And now, I'm in the Europe continents, which I have never imagined to come here before. I'm a student in RWTH Aachen University and my study focuses on Applied Geoscience.

I've always been so excited with numbers and handling data, so feel free to check it out my portfolio [here](/portofolio/). I also passionate about spatial data, which I explore through [GIS](/gis/). Besides study and work, I'm all about traveling, drawing, photography, and reading. Feel free to look at my [artworks](/artwork/).

Let's stay in touch! Drop me a message at jesslyn [dot] jane [dot] k [at] gmail [dot] com. See you there :)
