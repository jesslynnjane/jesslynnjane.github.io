*An art painting showcase : oil & acrylic drawings*

<i>Author: Jesslyn Jane</i>


## Background 

Before jumping to oil painting, I have gone through [black & white](https://jesslynnjane.github.io/artwork/black-white-world/) pencil drawings, [coloured pencils](https://jesslynnjane.github.io/artwork/pencil-color-world/), and [watercolour](https://jesslynnjane.github.io/artwork/watercolor-world/).

After understanding deeper in watercolor, I've added oil painting skill. Oil painting is a technique that uses oil-based pigments, typically on canvas, to create rich and textured works of art. It is known for its vibrant colors, smooth blending, and versatility, allowing artists to achieve both detailed and layered effects. Compared to watercolor, oil paint takes longer to dry, providing more time to work on details or make adjustments.

Due to a long duration in drying process, I only produced 3 oil paintings so far. I remembered it really took me a long run to finish just one of them because of the layering process.

One day, I joined an acrylic art jam in Singapore with my husband and I fell in love with it. Acrylic painting uses fast-drying paints made of pigment that suspended in an acrylic polymer. Itâ€™s versatile and can be used on various surfaces like canvas, paper, or wood. Acrylics dry much faster than oil paints, which can take days or weeks, making them great for quick projects. Unlike watercolor, which is light and transparent, acrylics can be used both transparently (like watercolor) and opaquely (like oil). 

## Materials

The supplies needed for oil and acrylic painting are similar to those for watercolor. The main differences are in the types of paint, paper, and brushes. I use Reeves and Winsor & Newton for oil paints, and Maries for acrylics.
