*An art painting showcase : a watercolor painting*

<i>Author: Jesslyn Jane</i>


## Background 

Watercolor painting was the third step in my artistic journey, following my experience with [black & white](https://jesslynnjane.github.io/artwork/black-white-world/) pencil drawings and creating colorful pieces with [coloured pencils](https://jesslynnjane.github.io/artwork/pencil-color-world/).

My art teacher was pleased with my colored pencil work and encouraged me to learn a more advanced technique: watercolor. At first, I found it quite frustrating because watercolor painting involves both a brush and water as key elements, which felt very different from colored pencils. It took me more than three years to become comfortable with it (and I’d say I’m still improving). By the time I reached my first or second year of high school, I finally started to get the hang of it.

What I love most about watercolor painting is that it doesn’t take a lot of time to create an artwork. If detailed work is required, it does take longer, but a simple piece can be finished in around 30 minutes.

## Materials

The essential supplies for watercolor painting are paint, paper, and brushes. Other useful materials include palettes, water jars, and cloth or paper towels.

During my beginner phase, I used Pentel paste-based paint and frequently relied on a bottle of white paint, which I bought separately.

Currently, I use Joyko watercolor pockets, which are more efficient and portable. The colors are vibrant and work really well!
