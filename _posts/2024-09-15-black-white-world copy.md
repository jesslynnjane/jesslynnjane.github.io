*An art painting showcase : a pencil colour drawing*

<i>Author: Jesslyn Jane</i>


## Background 

Before I share about how I started my journey in pencil colour, I experimented with black-and-white pencil art, as described in my [Black & White](https://jesslynnjane.github.io/artwork/black-white-world/) article.

I have always been passionate about colors in my life. I donâ€™t have a specific favorite color because I believe every color has its own uniqueness, and I wanted to explore pencil art with colors more deeply. Because of this, I proposed to my teacher during my first year of secondary school. It felt like a whole new world of my artistic exploration.

## Materials

Over the past decade, many brands of colored pencils have become available. For beginners, I highly recommend starting with Staedtler Luna Watercolour pencils as a first step into the world of colored pencil art.

As time went on, I explored other brands like Faber-Castell and Derwent. Each brand has its own distinct style, and it really depends on which suits your artistic preference. Personally, I believe a professional artist doesn't need the best brand for every material.

> It is the experience and exploration that make one truly skilled.

Another crucial factor is the type of paper. Initially, I used regular paper meant for crayons or black-and-white drawing, but I soon noticed that when layering different colors, unwanted spots would appear, which frustrated me. I eventually discovered that budget-friendly options like Canson Watercolor paper solved this issue. Although the paper has some texture, it adds depth and beauty to my artwork.
