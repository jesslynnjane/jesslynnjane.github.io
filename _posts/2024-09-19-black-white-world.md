*An art painting showcase : a black & white world*

<i>Author: Jesslyn Jane</i>


## Background 

It all started when I was in 5th grade. My art teacher asked me to draw with a pencil instead of crayons. He gave me some black-and-white photos and asked me to recreate them in my own style. It didn't feel like I had to learn a new skill for these artworks, but I did need to develop patience to follow each stroke. Sometimes, when you're not in the mood to draw, it's hard to produce your best work.

## Materials

I used Staedtler pencils, starting with types HB, B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, and going up to 6B. These pencils were perfect for beginners, and I still use them to create black-and-white pieces today.
